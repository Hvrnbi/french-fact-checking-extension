# french-fact-checking-extension
A browser extension in the early stages of development that will attempt to provide reliable sources for information viewed by the user. It will initially be developed for French sites, then for English sites.

The idea is to provide reliable articles when the user is highlighting a text.

# Installation
If you are using a firefox based browser, you can test the extension by cloning this repo, going on this page : about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox adn then click on "Load Temporary Add-on" and selecting the manifest.json file.


If you are using a chromium based browser, clone this repo, go to chrome://extensions, actviate the Developer mode, click on "Load unpacked" and then select the extension directory.

# The extension is not working right now, I'm trying my best to make a usable version ASAP.
